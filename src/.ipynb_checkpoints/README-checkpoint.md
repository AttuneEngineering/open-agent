## USING THE CODE

#### Setting Environment Variables
API keys are managed as environment variabled in your local environment. These should be set prior to running a jupyter server or executing any scripts.
  ```bash
  export GITHUB_TOKEN="xxx"
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="xxx"
  export SERPAPI_API_KEY="xxx"
  ```
_note_... this can also be done using the Python [dotenv](https://configu.com/blog/using-py-dotenv-python-dotenv-package-to-manage-env-variables/) package.
